CHAPTER ONE 

The Boy Who Lived 



Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four. Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were very 
normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in 
anj^hing strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. 

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He 

was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. 
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which 
came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying 
on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there 
was no finer boy anywhere. 

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their 
greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if 
anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't 
met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her 
sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. 
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in 
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never 
even see him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't 
want Dudley mixing with a child like that. 

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, 
there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious 
things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked 
out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled 
a screaming Dudley into his high chair. 

None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window. 

At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the 
cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a 
tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. 'Little tyke,' chortled Mr Dursley as he left 
the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. 

It was on the comer of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar 
- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn't realise what he had seen - then he 
jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the comer of 
Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It 
must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared 
back. As Mr Dursley drove around the comer and up the road, he watched the cat in his 
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive - no, looking at the sign; cats 
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of 
his mind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills 
he was hoping to get that day. 



But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As 
he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be 
a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn't bear people 
who dressed in funny clothes - the get-ups you saw on young people! He supposed this 
was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes 
fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly 
together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, 
that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of 
him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt - these people 
were obviously collecting for something. . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, 
and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on 
drills. 

Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. 
If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't 
see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people in the street did; they pointed 
and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen 
an owl even at night-time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free 
morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls 
and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunch-time, when he thought 
he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker's 
opposite. 

He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next 
to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made 
him uneasy. This lot were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single 
collecting tin. It was on this way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that 
he caught a few words of what they were saying. 

'The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard -' 

'- yes, their son, Harry -' 

Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooder him. He looked back at the whisperers as 
if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. 

He dashed back across the road, hurried to his office, snapped at his secretary not 
to disturb him, seized his telephone and had almost finished dialling his home number 
when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his moustache, 
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure 
there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, 
he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might 
have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley, she always 
got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her - if he 'd had a sister like 
that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . . 

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon, and when he left 
the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that we walked straight into someone 
just outside the door. 



'Sorry,' he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few 
seconds before Mr Dursley realised that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't 
seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split 
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passers-by stare: 'Don't be 
sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has 
gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!' 

And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off. 

Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. 
He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He 
hurried to his car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never 
hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. 

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw - and it didn't 
improve his mood - was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on 
his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its 
eyes. 

'Shoo!' said Mr Dursley loudly. 

The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behaviour, 
Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to put himself together, he let himself into the house. He 
was still determined not to mention anj^hing to his wife. 

Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs 
Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learnt a new word 
('Shan't!'). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went 
into the living-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: 

'And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have 
been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly 
ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every 
direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly 
changed their sleeping pattern.' The news reader allowed himself a grin. 'Most 
mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more 
showers of owls tonight, Jim?' 

'Well, Ted,' said the weatherman, 'I don't know about that, but it's not only the 
owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and 
Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, 
they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire 
Night early - it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.' 

Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying 
by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper 
about the Potters . . . 

Mrs Dursley came into the living-room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. 
He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. 'Er - Petunia, dear - 
you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?' 



As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally 
pretended she didn't have a sister. 

'No,' she said sharply. 'Why?' 

'Funny stuff on the news,' Mr Dursley mumbled. 'Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and 
there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . . ' 

'So? ' snapped Mrs Dursley. 

'Well, I just thought . . . maybe ... it was something to do with . . . you know . . . 
her lot.' 

Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered whether he 
dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Potter'. He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as 
casually as he could, 'Their son - he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?' 

'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly. 

'What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?' 

'Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.' 

'Oh, yes,' said Mrs Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. 'Yes, I quite agree.' 

He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs 
Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down 
into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though 
it was waiting for something. 

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If 
it did ... it if got out that they were related to a pair of - well, he didn't think he could 
bear it. 

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay 
awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep 
was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him 
and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them 
and their kind ... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that 
might be going on. He yawned and turned over. It couldn't affect them . . . 

How very wrong he was. 

Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall 
outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed 
unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car 
door slammed in the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was 
nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. 

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly 
and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched 
and its eyes narrowed. 



Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He was tall, thin and 
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck 
into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high- 
heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon 
spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least 
twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. 

Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realise that he had just arrived in a street where 
everj^hing from his name to this boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his 
cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realise he was being watched, because 
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the 
street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and 
muttered, 'I should have known'. 

He had found what we has looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver 
cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street 
lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again - the next lamp flickered into darkness. 
Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left in the whole street were 
two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone 
looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn't be able to 
see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- 
Outer back inside his cloak and sett of down the street towards number four, where he sat 
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. 

'Fancy seeing you here. Professor McGonagalL'
